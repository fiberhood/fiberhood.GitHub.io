<H4>About the founder of The Flowers of Europe photo-flora and the future of the Flora</H4>
The Flowers of Europe photo-flora is a project that has its roots in the
hobby Aart Voswinkel started in 1968. After yearly trips around Europe to collect
pictures a sizable plant collection grew steadily. When I -his son Merik
Voswinkel- started the Internet provider Knoware in 1992 the publication of this
collection became possible and in 1994 the Flowers of Europe 1.0 website was put
on the internet by Aart. Since 1990 the effort became more professional and Aart
established the plan to build the collection into an scientifically correct photo
addition to the Flora Europea. The website quickly became very popular with
amateurs and scientists alike. 

<P>Before the publication Aart already knew that
because of his illness his remaining years would be limited. His response was to
put more time in the flora scientific discovery than ever before, spurred on by the many nice
reactions offered to the visiters and contributers of the website. I hereby thank
on behalf of Aart all the people who made his remaining years so joyfull and
happy with their incouragements, kind words and above all their donations of
thousands of pictures. The joy of seeing and scanning the new pictures helped
greatly in the struggle against his illness, prostate cancer. The thought that the work would
continue without him kept his spirits up until the very last. 

<P>
He still found the strenght to make a few of camping trips in between hospital visits.
This was possible because after 30 years his car was full of clever gadgets and tricks that 
Aart had built himself over the years. 
His handicaps therefore never stopped him from camping in the wild, we even had plans 
for a last three months tour of the wilds of Southern Europe and his favorate places.
I am very greatfull that I could be with him in these last joyous moments in nature, 
hoping to remember him as an great example of how to enjoy life to the fullest.

<P>After two weeks in intensive care he finally succumed to the effects of an operation 
on the 13th of August 1998, letting his life slip away quitly and peacefully. 
He felt that life had given him all he had hoped for, full with joy of nature, 
science and filled love of people.

<H4>Into the future</H4>
Aarts wish that this project would grow in a worldwide
collaboration of plant enthousiasts, profesionals and amateurs alike seems more
likely every day, judging from the many contributions and kind advice that keeps
coming in by email, phone and post. In 1997 the plan to set up a foundation to
further support this project became reality. In 1998, this final year of Aarts life
we bought and tested professional equipment to process the thousands of slides
that keep coming in.
<P>
The need to earn money to support the project arose and will
result in a request for membership contribution and the sale of flora CDs (to
ease the identification of plants) will start in 1999. Aart and I hoped that we
can continue to distribute the photo's in this and other ways. Whenever possible I will
also release parts of the plant database in the public domain to support the
collection of a wordwide biodiversity database for free or at cost price, to help
preserve the lifeforms of this planet. All these plans can only succeed if more
people join us in donating pictures and time. We will however not forget those of
you make a living out of plant photo collecting, trying to combine these efforts
 into a database accessable to all.
<P>I hereby dedicate this and future publications posthumously to Aart Voswinkel.
