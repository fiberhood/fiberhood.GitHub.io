<table> <tr> <td> <H2>Genus: Onosma</H2> <H3> Genus description: </H3>Biennial or perennial, hispid herbs.  Flowers in terminal, usuallybranched, bracteate cymes.  Calyx lobed almost to then base, oftenaccrescent.  Corolla yellow, whitis or purplish, tubular totubular-campanulate, with 5 short, patent or deflexed lobes, withoutscales, but with an annulus near the base.  Stamens included orexserted, inserted at about the middle of the corolla; anthers sagittateat base, usually with a projecting connective at the apex.  Styleexserted; stigma capitate to bifid.  Nutlets somtimes fewer than 4 byabortion, ovoid or trigonous, acute or beaked, erect, smooth ortuberculate, with triangular, flat base.<P>In addition to the setae withan enlarged base. known for many genera of the Boraginaceae, manyspecies of Onosma have setae with usually 4-20 rays arising from thebase.  These are referred to as stellate setae, and are fully describedby Javorka (loc.sit). The central seta is occasionally absent from thesehairs, but usually it is distincly longer  and stouter than the rays.The description of the stellate setae in this account are of those foundon the lower leaves.<P>The genus presents considerable taxonomicdifficulties , particularly in C. & S.E Europe, which cannot be resolvedwithout experimental investigation. The presence or absence of stellatesetae is widely used as major character in the genus, but in a number ofspecies (particularly 13-20) ther may be a wde range of variation in thepresence, frequency and length of the stellate setae. There has, in thepast, been considerable nomemclatural confusion and the following nameshave been widely misapplied: O.echiodes, O.setosa, O.stellulata andO.taurica<P>All species occur in dry, sunny habitats.<P><STRONG><U>Species and images:</U></STRONG><P> <UL> <LI><AHREF="O.fastigiata.html">O.fastigiata</A> <UL> <LI><AHREF="O.fastigiata/1.total.jpeg">  image:1.total.jpeg (54kb)</A> <LI><AHREF="O.fastigiata/2.detailjpeg">  image:2.detailjpeg (15kb)</A> </UL></UL> </td> <td> <script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client ="pub-0748382504364839"; /* MacMerikFloraB */ google_ad_slot ="2739593908"; google_ad_width = 160; google_ad_height = 600; //--></script> <script type="text/javascript"src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"> </script></td> </tr> </table>
