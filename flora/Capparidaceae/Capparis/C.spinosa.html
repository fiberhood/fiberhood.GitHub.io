<title>Capparis spinosa</title><H2>Species: Capparis spinosa </H2><PRE><B>Family:</B> Capparidaceae  <B>Genus: </B> Capparis</PRE><B> Species description: </B>Leaves glabrous, petiolate, orbicular or orbicular-ovate;, obtuse or emarginate at apex. Stipular spines recurved, sometimes weakly developed.  Flowers 5-7 cM in diameter, slightly zygomorphic, sepals purplish.<P>There has been selection for large flower-buts in the typical plant (which is probably introduced in the western part of its distribution) for their use of condiment.  A distinctive coastal variant with pendent branches, somewhat succulent leaves, and stipular spines absent or caducous at an early stage, is probably more widespread as a natave plant (var. intermes). <P> <B>Field Notes: </B><P><B>Habitat: </B></P><B>Distribution: </B> Mediterranean region; Portugal; Krym.
