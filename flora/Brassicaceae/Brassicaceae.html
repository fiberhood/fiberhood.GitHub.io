<H2>Family: Brassicaceae</H2> <H3> Family description: </H3>Annual to perennial herbs, rarely small shrubs.  Leaves alternate, exstipulate.  Flowers usually hermaphrodite, actinomorphic, hypogynous.  Sepals 4, free, in 2 decussate pairs.  Petals 4, rarely absent, free, clawed, imbricate or contorted, alternating with the sepals.  Stamens usally 6, rarely 4, 2 or 0, tetradynamous (an outer pair with short filaments, and two inner pairs, one posterior and one anterior, with long filaments);  filaments sometimes winged or with a tooth-like appendage.  Nectarial glands of various sizes, shapes, colours and dispositions around the base of the stamens and ovary.  Ovary of 2 carpels, syncarpous, with 2 parietal placentas, usually bilocular through the formation of a membranous false septum by the union of outgrowths of the placentas;  sometimes transversely plurilocular.  Stigma capitate to bilobed.  Fruit usually a dehiscent capsule opening by 2 valves from below, called a siliqua when at least 3 times as long as wide, or a silicula if less than 3 times as long as wide;  sometimes indehiscent, breaking into 1-seeded portions or not;  rarely transversely articulate with dehiscent and indehiscent segments, sometimes divided at maturity into 1-seeded portions (lomentum).  Seeds in 1 or 2 rows in each loculus.<P>There is great diversity in the form  and structure of the fruit in this family, often affording an easy means of identification, especially in genera which do not posses a normal siliqua or silicula.<P>
