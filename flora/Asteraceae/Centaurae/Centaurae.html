<table><tr><td><H2>Genus: Centaurae</H2><H3> Genus description: </H3> Annual to perennial herbs, rarely dwarf shrubs.  Leaves undivided to pinnatisect.  Capitula solitary or in groups of 2-3 at apex of braches.  Involucre cylindrical to globose;  bracts often with fimbriate or spiny appendage.  Inner florets hermaphrodite; outer sterile, often radiate; corolla tubular. 5(-8)-fid.  Achenes somewhat compressed.  Pappus usually present, persistent or rarely caducous, of 2 or several rows of scabrid to plumose setea or oblong to linear scales; innermost row short, the setea or scales sometimes connate at the base, usually differing in shape or texture from the outer; outer rows imbricat, the inner the longest.<P>The problem of a practical and natural division of this vast genus still remains to be solved.  Some subgenera and sections stand clearly apart and seem comparable to other genera already recognized within the Centaureineae, but the status of others is still uncertain.  A very thourough study, involving many lines of evidence, may well provide a basis for further division of Centaurea, but ther is little general agreement that this can be done with the present information.  In view of the prevaling uncertainty and the drastic nomenclatural consequences which would result from further generic splitting, it has been decided to adopt a relatively conservative circumscription,<P>Description of leaves refer to the lower caukine, and of appendages and fimbriae to those of the middle involucral bracts, unless otherwise stated.  Diameter of involucre is measured at anthesis and is exclusive of spines.<P><STRONG><U>Species and images:</U></STRONG><P><UL><LI><A HREF="C.pullata.html">C.pullata</A><UL><LI><A HREF="C.pullata/1.total.jpeg">  image:1.total.jpeg (84kb)</A><LI><A HREF="C.pullata/2.close.jpeg">  image:2.close.jpeg (39kb)</A></UL></UL></td><td><script type="text/javascript"><!--google_ad_client = "pub-0748382504364839";/* MacMerikFloraB */google_ad_slot = "2739593908";google_ad_width = 160;google_ad_height = 600;//--></script><script type="text/javascript"src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"></script></td></tr></table>
