<H2>Family: Araceae</H2> <H3> Family description: </H3>Perennial, usually glabrous herbs, with underground rhizomes or  tubers. Leaves all basal, usually with distinct petiole, and often with more or less reticulate venation.  Flowers small, often unisexual, arranged in a compact spike (spadix), subtended and usually partially enfolded by a large, petaloid or leave-like bract (spathe), the axis of the spadix often prolonged beyond the flower-bearing zone as a fleshy, usually coloured appendix.  In monoecious plants the female flowers are at or near the base of the spadix, the male flowers above them; vestigial, sterile flowers, usually in the form of filiform papillae, may also be present.  Periath of 4-6 free, sepaloid segments, or (more usually) absent.Stamens 1-6, rarely more.  Ovary superior or nude, sometimes sunk in the axis of the spadix,  1- or 3-locular; stigma usually sessile or subsessile. Fruit a berry, sometimes rather dry.<P>A large family, centered in the wet tropics, were it includes many epiphytes and climbers.  The majority of European species have more or less flowers and are pollinated by flies.<P>Measurements of the scape include the spadix and spathe.<P>
