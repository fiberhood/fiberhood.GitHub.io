A good working methode is via dia-film: no extra printings are necesary, while the  pictures can be selected on a simple plateau,viewing them through a loupe. An AppleScript program was written to createthe ww-pages from a FMPro-database. <BR>In the  - far - future we might be able to digitalize our own dia's, in which case you could send me your dia's, etc.<H3>Warning:</H3>The Kodak Photo-CD methode is good, but it is clearly automated: there is not much garanty, that your (excellent) pictures will be as good on a Photo-CD. They might be to dark, or to light, and in both instances much information is lost, and this lost can not be corrected. <BR>So, <B>do not accept CD-pictures that are clearly out of line</B>.<BR>A good arrangement with yourintermediary photo-shopkeeper can be important.<HR><ADDRESS>A.Voswinkel; email: aart@knoware.nl</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
