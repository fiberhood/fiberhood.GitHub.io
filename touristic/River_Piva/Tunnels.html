Sight from the bridge, looking into the unknown: bumpy dirt road, dripping water, only we and our little car. Going to the hydro-electric power-station under construction.  It was in the first tunnel that we found "the cow" (look under animals). <P> <B>Place:        </B>C.Jugoslavia; Bosnia-Herzegovina</P><B>Date:         </B>1976</P><B>Notes:        </B></P><B>Pictures    :</B> A.Voswinkel, the Netherlands</P><B>email       :</B> aart@knoware.nl<P>
